Full-featured Code Editor
Pythonista's professional code editor provides syntax highlighting, smart code completion, and an extended on-screen keyboard specifically designed for Python.

A convenient outline view allows you to navigate your scripts efficiently, and multiple tabs make it easy to work on larger projects.

Powerful Interactive Prompt
When you want to quickly try a snippet of code or perform an ad-hoc calculation, the interactive prompt is always just a swipe away. You can also use it to inspect the results of your scripts interactively.

The console also provides support for showing images and plots when working with the included matplotlib and PIL (Python Imaging Library) modules.

===

Graphics and Multi-Touch
Pythonista comes with easy-to-use libraries for 2D graphics, multitouch and sound effects. You can even use the accelerometer to create motion-controlled games or interactive experiments.

Lots of ready-to-run examples are included, so you can get started right away.

Batteries Included
In addition to the powerful Python standard library, Pythonista includes several modules specifically designed for iOS.

You can write automation scripts with access to data from the clipboard, your contacts, reminders, and photos. You can also use your device's motion sensors and geo-location data, and Pythonista is probably the easiest way to experiment with Twitter APIs.

And if something's not covered yet, you can even access native Objective-C APIs from Python.

===

NumPy and MatPlotLib
Pythonista includes the powerful NumPy and matplotlib packages for scientific computation and data visualization.

Plots are shown directly in the console output, and you can easily save them to your photo library, or tap to zoom in.

===

Extended Keyboard and Snippets
The keyboard has been designed specifically for Python and includes common special characters. Of course there's also full support for external keyboards, including lots of convenient shortcuts.

With the new snippet system in 3.0, you can insert frequently-used blocks of code much more quickly.

Color Themes
A variety of tasteful light and dark color themes allow you to customize the editor's UI and syntax highlighting. New in version 3.0, you can even create your own themes.

===

UI Editor
With the integrated UI Editor, you can create user interfaces for your scripts without writing any code.

===

Complete Documentation
You can read the entire Python documentation within the app â€” no internet connection required. Context-sensitive help is also available directly from the code editor.

===

Universal App
Pythonista is a universal app that runs on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch with just one purchase (and no in-app purchases).
